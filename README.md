# A Data-Driven Approach for the Analysis of Behavioral Disorders With a Focus on Classification and Severity Estimation

Abstract

It has been well-established that behavioral disorders such as depression and schizophrenia are hard to diagnose. Classifying the type of the disorder is a challenging task because
of the diversity of the symptoms. Furthermore, estimation of the severity level of such disorders is another challenging factor in the diagnosis process. Current clinical diagnostic procedures tend
to be mostly dependent on the self-reporting of patients or the limited observational evaluations of clinicians. Hence, there is a need for objective analytical methods that leverage the current
informatics advancements in studying behavior disorders. In this study, we proposed two major contributions. First, we introduce a data-driven approach that takes advantage of the available public
databases to differentiate between multiple behavioral disorders. Second, we developed an index (Behavioral Health Score (BHS)) to assess the severity level. The proposed approach is based on the
established correlations between mobility and health by analyzing the mobility data collected from 72 participants suffering from multiple behavioral disorders using wearable sensors. Obtained
results demonstrate that the proposed correlation network model can distinguish between different types of disorders and BHS index can be utilized to estimate the severity levels of the disorder.
Moreover, the proposed model can add a useful information to healthcare providers to better diagnose behavioral conditions and develop data-driven treatment options.
